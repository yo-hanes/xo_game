This project uses Arduino to implement the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using C++ programming. Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as XO, is a popular two-player game in which players in turn mark spaces in a 3x3 grid with their respective symbols (X or O) in order to get three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal.

This Arduino project uses LED lights (red and blue) instead of the traditional X and O symbols. The hardware setup includes RGB LEDs and push buttons. Providing visual feedback and enabling simple gameplay.

The Arduino board's C++ code handles game logic, player input, and output to hardware components. It controls the flow of the game by checking for win conditions, detecting draws, and restarting it.
